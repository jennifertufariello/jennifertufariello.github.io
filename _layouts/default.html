      <p>
    Going into my freshman year at SJU, I decided that I did not want to major in the maths or sciences.
    I wanted a major that would give me the flexbility to grow and discover what I am passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a communications major has opened a lot of doors.
      It has provided me with a lot of opportunites for my impending post graduation career. I feel prepared to graduate because I feel comfortable with my knowledge skill set.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of my sophomore year, I decided to declare a marketing minor to coincide with my communications major.
      I felt that the two complemented each other and would be a useful combination. Communications and Marketing have a lot in common, yet at the same time are vastly different.

      <p>
      I wanted to get more involved on campus at the end of my freshman year, so I decided to volunteer for weekly service. I visited sites outside of campus and met some really wonderful people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently the Community Partnership Coordinator (CPC) at SJU for The Simpson House.
      A group of 5-10 students join me every week on Friday's and we spend time with the elderly for an hour and a half. We have fun bonding with the residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to continue leading this site next semester. I want to recruit more students to join our volunteer team.
      It is my mission to find a new student who can replace my position when I graduate. Ideally this would be a student that is dedicated to service every week.
      I want to pass on the tradition!

      <p>
        During the summer of 2014, I got an internship in New York City at The Berman Group. I assisted with Public Relations and Advertising for new establishments and restaraunts.
      I learned a lot of valuable and fundamenal skills that year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the youngest intern at The Berman Group, but I felt equipped and prepared to excel at my first real job. I was excited because I had recently declared a Marketing minor.
        I wanted to try my hand at new projects and experiences.
